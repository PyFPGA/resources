# Shared resources of PyFPGA

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/PyFPGA/resources.svg?longCache=true)](https://github.com/PyFPGA/resources/blob/main/LICENSE)

Shared resources (HDL and constraint files) between projects of the [PyFPGA](https://github.com/PyFPGA) organization.

The content of this repository could be basic, sometimes non-synthesizable, but useful to run examples/test of
[PyFPGA](https://github.com/PyFPGA/pyfpga) and its subproject [Openflow](https://github.com/PyFPGA/openflow),
and also to perform some [Proofs of concept](https://github.com/PyFPGA/poc).
