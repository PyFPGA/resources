# PyFPGA's shared resources [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-darkgreen?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

Shared resources (HDL and constraint files) between projects of the [PyFPGA](https://github.com/PyFPGA) organization.

The content of this repository is basic, sometimes non-synthesizable, but useful to run examples/test of
[PyFPGA](https://github.com/PyFPGA/pyfpga) and its subprojects [Openflow](https://github.com/PyFPGA/openflow),
[FPGA Helpers](https://github.com/PyFPGA/helpers) and [Proofs of concept](https://github.com/PyFPGA/poc).

> **NOTE:** for more useful/complete constraint files, you can check the
> [hdl/constraints](https://github.com/hdl/constraints) project.
